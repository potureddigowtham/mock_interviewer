# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop user authentication and authorization for candidates, coaches, and administrators.
# Details:
Use OAuth2 or JWT for secure authentication. Store user roles (candidate, coach, admin) in a database. Implement login/logout endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, role-based access, and session management.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design User Model and Role Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the user schema including fields for username, email, hashed password, and role (candidate, admin). Ensure scalability for future roles and attributes.
### Details:
Include validation rules and consider extensibility for additional user attributes. Document the model for future reference.

## 2. Integrate OAuth2 and JWT Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up OAuth2 flow for authentication and implement JWT issuance and validation for stateless session management.
### Details:
Configure JWT secret management, token expiration, and refresh logic. Ensure compatibility with the user model.

## 3. Implement Password Hashing and Secure Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Integrate a secure password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) for storing user passwords.
### Details:
Enforce strong password policies and salt passwords before hashing. Store only hashed passwords in the database.

## 4. Develop Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement middleware or logic to enforce access control based on user roles (candidate, admin) for protected routes.
### Details:
Define permissions for each role and ensure unauthorized access is properly handled with appropriate error responses.

## 5. Create Authentication Endpoints (Login, Logout, Protected Routes) [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Develop RESTful endpoints for user login (JWT issuance), logout (token invalidation if applicable), and protected resources.
### Details:
Ensure endpoints validate credentials, issue JWTs, and restrict access to protected routes based on authentication and roles.

## 6. Conduct Security Testing and Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Perform security testing including password brute-force resistance, JWT validation, RBAC enforcement, and session management robustness.
### Details:
Test for common vulnerabilities (e.g., token leakage, privilege escalation, weak password storage). Review code for adherence to security best practices and scalability.
